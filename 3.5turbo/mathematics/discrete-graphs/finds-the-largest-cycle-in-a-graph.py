Sure! Here's a Python script that finds the largest cycle in a graph. It uses the NetworkX library, which is a powerful tool for working with graphs.

Make sure to install NetworkX by running `pip install networkx` before running the script.

```python
import networkx as nx

def find_largest_cycle(graph):
    """
    Finds the largest cycle in a graph.

    Args:
        graph: A NetworkX graph object.

    Returns:
        A list of nodes representing the largest cycle found.
    """
    largest_cycle = []
    cycles = nx.simple_cycles(graph)
    for cycle in cycles:
        if len(cycle) > len(largest_cycle):
            largest_cycle = cycle
    return largest_cycle

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Create a graph
    graph = nx.DiGraph()
    
    # Add nodes
    graph.add_nodes_from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
    
    # Add edges
    graph.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (3, 7)])
    
    # Find the largest cycle
    largest_cycle = find_largest_cycle(graph)
    print("Largest Cycle:", largest_cycle)
```

This script first creates a graph using the NetworkX library. Then, it uses the `nx.simple_cycles` function to find all cycles in the graph. Finally, it iterates over these cycles and keeps track of the largest one found. The resulting largest cycle is printed as output.

You can run this script by saving it in a file (e.g., `task.py`) and executing `python task.py` in the command line.
