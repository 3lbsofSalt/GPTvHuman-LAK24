Certainly! Here's a generic implementation of the State design pattern in Python:

```python
class Context:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = None

    def set_state(self, state):
        self.state = state

    def perform_operation(self):
        if self.state is not None:
            self.state.do_operation(self)


class State:
    def do_operation(self, context):
        pass


class ConcreteStateA(State):
    def do_operation(self, context):
        print("Performing operation A")
        # Update context state if necessary
        context.set_state(ConcreteStateB())


class ConcreteStateB(State):
    def do_operation(self, context):
        print("Performing operation B")
        # Update context state if necessary
        context.set_state(ConcreteStateA())


# Usage example
if __name__ == '__main__':
    context = Context()

    # Setting initial state to ConcreteStateA
    context.set_state(ConcreteStateA())

    # Performing operations
    for _ in range(5):
        context.perform_operation()
```

In this example, we have a `Context` class that represents the object whose behavior changes based on its internal state. The `Context` class has a `state` attribute which is an instance of `State` (an abstract class or interface).

Each concrete implementation of `State` overrides the `do_operation` method to perform the required operation based on the current state. The `do_operation` method may also update the context state if necessary.

In the `main` block, we create a `context` object, set its initial state to `ConcreteStateA`, and then perform a series of operations on the context. The actual operation performed depends on the current context state.

Note that you should save this code in a file named `task.py` and run it using the command `python task.py`.
