Certainly! Here's a Python script that mimics the functionality of the `wc` Unix tool:

```python
import sys

def word_count(file_content):
    lines = file_content.split("\n")
    word_count = sum(len(line.split()) for line in lines)
    return word_count

def line_count(file_content):
    lines = file_content.split("\n")
    line_count = len(lines)
    return line_count

def character_count(file_content):
    character_count = len(file_content)
    return character_count

# Read the file contents from standard input
file_content = sys.stdin.read()

# Perform word count, line count, and character count
wc_output = {
    "word_count": word_count(file_content),
    "line_count": line_count(file_content),
    "character_count": character_count(file_content)
}

# Print the wc output
print(wc_output)
```

To use this script, save it as `wc.py` and run it using the command `python wc.py`. It will read the file contents from standard input. You can pipe the contents of a file to the script using the command `cat file.txt | python wc.py`.

The script defines three functions: `word_count`, `line_count`, and `character_count`. These functions calculate the respective counts based on the provided file content.

The main part of the script reads the file content from standard input using `sys.stdin.read()`. Then, it calls the counting functions and stores the results in a dictionary `wc_output`. Finally, it prints the `wc_output` dictionary, which contains the word count, line count, and character count.
